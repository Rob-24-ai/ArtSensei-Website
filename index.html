            <h2>The feedback problem</h2>
            <p>
                You make work. You want honest, thoughtful responses—not "nice colors!" or generic tips from YouTube. But substantive critique is hard to find. Art school ended. Your community scattered. Open critiques feel awkward. And most people, even well-meaning ones, don't know how to look at a painting.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need someone who can actually see what's happening in your work.

                ArtSensei is an AI trained to give the kind of critique you'd get from a thoughtful peer or mentor—someone who knows formal analysis, understands art history, and can articulate what's working in your piece and what isn't. Built by artists who studied and taught at SAIC, Yale, NYAA, RISD, and MICA.

                ArtSensei is for professional painters, art students, and committed hobbyists—people who show up to the studio and want to get better. If you're looking for tutorials on how to draw an eye, this isn't for you. If you wish you had access to sharper critique but don't have a program or community that provides it, we built this for you.
