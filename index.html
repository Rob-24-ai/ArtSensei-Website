            <p>
                You make work. You want honest, thoughtful responses—not "nice colors!" or generic tips from YouTube. But substantive critique is hard to find. Art school's over. Maybe you never went. Your community scattered. Open critiques feel awkward. And most people, even well-meaning ones, don't know how to look at a painting.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need someone who can actually see what's happening in your work.

                ArtSensei gives you the kind of critique you'd get from a thoughtful peer or mentor—grounded in formal analysis and art history. Built by artists who studied and taught at SAIC, Yale, NYU, NYAA, RISD, and MICA.
