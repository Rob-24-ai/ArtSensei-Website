# ArtSensei Newsletter Template: Take a Closer Look

## Format

**Frequency:** Weekly  
**Length:** ~300 words max  
**Structure:** One artist, one artwork, one feature to notice

---

## Template

```
Subject: [Artist Last Name]: [Feature in 3-5 words]

---

**[ARTWORK TITLE]**  
[Artist Full Name], [Date]

[IMAGE]

[One sentence bio that earns the feature. Why this artist for this observation? Connect their life/practice to what we're about to look at. Not biography for its own sake—biography that sets up the looking.]

**The closer look:**

[1-2 sentences identifying the specific feature. Be concrete—point to what's actually happening in the painting. Not interpretation. What to see.]

[2-3 sentences on how that feature works. Not technique instruction (that's Marcel's job). Just enough to help them notice it. This should feel like someone pointing at a painting next to you in a museum.]

**This week:**

[Looking prompt. One sentence. A question or task they can carry into their own looking—at museums, online, or in their own work.]

---

[One-line ArtSensei tie-in. Connects the feature to something Marcel can analyze in their work. Not a pitch—a nudge.]

```

## Voice Guidelines

- Direct, no hedging
- Present tense
- Assume they can see what you're pointing at
- No art history lectures
- Bio earns the feature—connects life/practice to what we're looking at
- No technique instruction (that's the app)
- Trust their intelligence

---

## What This Is Not

- A career overview
- A technique lesson
- A biography (bio earns the looking, nothing more)
- An art history essay
- A sales pitch

---

## ArtSensei Tie-In Examples

Match the feature to a Marcel question:

| Feature | Tie-In |
|---------|--------|
| Value structure | "Ask Marcel about your value organization" |
| Edge handling | "Ask Marcel where your edges are doing work" |
| Compositional center | "Ask Marcel what's holding your composition together" |
| Color temperature | "Ask Marcel about your warm/cool relationships" |
| Detail placement | "Ask Marcel where your detail is paying off" |
| Light logic | "Ask Marcel how your light is organized" |
| Negative space | "Ask Marcel about what's not in your painting" |

## Production Notes

- Batch 10-12 at a time
- All artists must be public domain (died before 1929)
- Images from museum collections with open access
- Rotate women artists / secondary artists / canonical—don't cluster
- Archive builds into lead magnet / evergreen content
