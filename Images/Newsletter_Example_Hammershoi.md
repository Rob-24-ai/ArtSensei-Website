**INTERIOR IN STRANDGADE, SUNLIGHT ON THE FLOOR**  
Vilhelm Hammershøi, 1901

Hammershøi spent his career painting the same few rooms in his Copenhagen apartment, which made him obsessive about what most painters ignore: what happens inside grey.

**The closer look:**

The walls aren't grey. Look again. They're shifting between warm and cool across the surface—a faint ochre where light grazes them, a cooler violet-grey in the turns. Hammershøi builds an entire atmosphere out of what most painters would call "neutral."

This is value control at an extreme. The whole painting lives in maybe three steps of the value scale, and yet there's air in the room. The figure reads. The window reads. The floor catches actual sunlight. He's not relying on contrast to separate things—he's relying on temperature and the subtlest value shifts. The walls aren't backdrop. They're doing the work.

**This week:**

Find a wall in your house in indirect light. How many colors are in it?

Ask Marcel about the value range in your painting—and whether your "neutral" areas are actually doing something.
